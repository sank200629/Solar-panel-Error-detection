# Solar-panel-Error-detection
An AI-based system for detecting cracks and dust on solar panels using Convolutional Neural Networks. The model classifies panels as clean, dusty, or cracked to support faster maintenance, reduce manual inspection, and improve solar energy efficiency, helping promote clean and sustainable energy use.
